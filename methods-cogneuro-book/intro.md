# Introduction

This book, "Methods in cognitive neurosciences", presents the main neuroimaging techniques used to study cognition in humans (and non-human animals) with a good spatial resolution:
 * Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): structural, functional, and diffusion,
 * Positron emission tomography (PET),
 * Optical imaging.

This book is intended as an introduction for readers discovering these neuroimaging methods for the first time. This book covers the theoretical foundations of the physical and physiological behind each technique. It also provides an introduction to the main image processing and statistical analysis methods involved in neuroimaging. Each chapter includes exercises and practical examples from cognitive neuroscience research projects to consolidate understating. 

```{warning}
This resource is not indented to be a detailed reference tool for specialists, explaining all the specific details associated with a given technique. Instead, the goal is to present a concise overview of the most common techniques in cognitive neuroscience. It aims to help readers appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of each technique and understand how to select the most appropriate one to answer a specific research question.
```

## Contributing

This project is being developed collaboratively. We welcome all suggestions! You can use the "[issue](https://github.com/methods-cogneuro/methods-cogneuro.github.io/issues)" page on Github to make a request to the team, or describe your problem. You can also propose a change directly by making a "pull request" on the book's [Github page](https://github.com/methods-cogneuro/methods-cogneuro.github.io).

## Contributors

This book was developed as a reference tool for the PSY3018 course, given in the bachelor's degree program in cognitive neuroscience at Universit√© de Montr√©al. The course is primarily taught by Dr. Pierre Bellec, with contributions from teaching assistants and many additional contributors. This book also benefits from constructive feedback from students who have taken the PSY3018 course since its inception in 2018. General contributions are acknowledged below, with specific contributions listed within each chapter.

 * The [Dipy](https://dipy.org) library, notably for the section on diffusion MRI.
 * The [MNE python](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html) library is used in the chapter on optical imaging.
 * The brain image visualizations used in the course come in part from public datasets. The origin of the data is indicated in the description of each figure.
 * The logo comes from <a href="https://www.vecteezy.com/free-vector/brain">Brain Vectors by Vecteezy</a>
 * Some images in the book were obtained under unlimited rights for web distribution and limited rights for print (500k copies) via [shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com) by P. Bellec.

 The authors are very grateful for the hard work and generosity of the communities that create and maintain all these projects!
